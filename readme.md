## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project performs a complete **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Visualization** on the **Students Performance in Exams** dataset (Kaggle source).  
The goal is to analyze factors affecting student academic performance using both **numerical and textual features**, and to implement a **deep learning model (MLP)** for predicting performance levels.

The project satisfies all requirements from the Assignment II instructions â€” including preprocessing, encoding, visualization (5+ plots), model building, and evaluation.
